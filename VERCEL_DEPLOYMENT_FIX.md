# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was returning a 404 error on Vercel due to incorrect configuration in `vercel.json`. The build was succeeding but Vercel couldn't find the Next.js application because it was looking in the wrong location.

## Root Cause
The original `vercel.json` was using an outdated configuration format that didn't properly handle the monorepo structure where the Next.js app is in the `frontend` subdirectory.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` to use Vercel's modern monorepo configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "info-repo-frontend",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "root": "frontend"
}
```

## Additional Files Created
1. `.vercelignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
2. `frontend/.env.example` - Documents required environment variables
3. `frontend/.gitignore` - Proper gitignore for Next.js projects

## Environment Variables Required
Set in Vercel dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app`)

## Verification
- Frontend runs successfully locally on port 3001
- Build completes without errors
- HTML output contains expected content
- All Next.js build artifacts are generated correctly

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
4. Frontend should be accessible without 404 errors
